# Testing Guide

## ⚠️ Important: Correct Test Command

### ❌ WRONG Command
```bash
bun test  # This runs Bun's test runner, NOT Playwright!
```

**Error you'll see:**
```
error: Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.
```

### ✅ CORRECT Commands

```bash
# Run tests (headless)
nix develop --command bun run test

# Interactive UI mode
nix develop --command bun run test:ui

# Headed browser mode
nix develop --command bun run test:headed

# Using nix run (convenience command)
nix run .#test
```

---

## 🔧 NixOS Setup (COMPLETED ✅)

Tests now work on NixOS! The flake.nix has been configured to use system Chromium.

### What's Configured

1. **System Chromium** - Uses `pkgs.chromium` instead of downloading browsers
2. **Environment variables** set automatically:
   - `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` - Points to system chromium
   - `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` - Prevents downloading browsers

3. **Playwright config** updated to use the system executable path

### How It Works

```nix
# flake.nix includes:
devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  packages = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
    pkgs.bun
    pkgs.chromium  # System browser
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=${pkgs.chromium}/bin/chromium
    export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
  '';
};
```

### Playwright Version Compatibility

⚠️ **Important**: Playwright npm package version must match nixpkgs version.

Current setup:
- nixpkgs playwright-driver: **1.54.1**
- package.json @playwright/test: **1.54.1**

If you see "Executable doesn't exist" errors, check version compatibility.

#### Option 2: Install System Deps (Non-NixOS)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo bunx playwright install-deps

# Then run tests
bun run test
```

#### Option 3: Use Docker
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN bun install
RUN bun run test
```

## 📊 Test Suite Overview

### 13 Test Scenarios

1. ✅ **Homepage rendering**
   - Landing note displays
   - Card is visible
   - Title present
   - Navigation buttons work

2. ✅ **Note page rendering**
   - Individual note pages load
   - Correct content displays
   - Navigation present

3. ✅ **Content validation**
   - Substantial text content (>50 chars)
   - Markdown rendered correctly
   - No empty pages

4. ✅ **Navigation functionality**
   - "Seuraava" button works
   - Navigates to correct URL
   - Card persists across pages

5. ✅ **Wiki links**
   - `[[Note Name]]` renders as links
   - Links point to correct routes
   - Clicking navigates successfully

6. ✅ **Metadata display**
   - Time, building, floor, location
   - Header metadata section visible
   - Items render correctly

7. ✅ **Vertical scroll indicator (card)**
   - `.scroll-indicator` visible
   - Track and thumb present
   - Located on right side of card

8. ✅ **Horizontal scroll progress (header)**
   - `.scroll-indicator-horizontal` visible
   - Track and thumb present
   - Height ~4px (horizontal bar)

9. ✅ **Scroll synchronization**
   - Scrolling card updates both indicators
   - Horizontal thumb width increases
   - Both indicators stay in sync

10. ✅ **Markdown paragraph spacing**
    - Multiple paragraphs detected
    - Gap between paragraphs >10px
    - Proper visual separation

11. ✅ **404 handling**
    - Non-existent routes return 404
    - Not-found page displays

12. ✅ **All content files accessible**
    - All 7 markdown files load
    - Each has content
    - No broken routes

## 🎯 Running Tests Locally

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Ensure dev server isn't already running
# (tests will start it automatically on port 3000/3001)

# 2. Run tests
nix develop --command bun run test
```

### Output Example (Success)
```
Running 13 tests using 6 workers

✓ homepage should render the landing note (2.3s)
✓ note page should render correctly (1.8s)
✓ note content should be rendered (1.5s)
✓ navigation between notes should work (2.1s)
✓ wiki links should be rendered as clickable links (2.4s)
✓ metadata should be displayed correctly (1.7s)
✓ vertical scroll indicator should be present on card (1.4s)
✓ horizontal scroll progress should be present in header (1.6s)
✓ scroll indicators should sync when scrolling (2.0s)
✓ markdown content should have proper paragraph spacing (1.5s)
✓ 404 page should work for non-existent notes (1.2s)
✓ all content files should be accessible (3.8s)

12 passed (24.3s)
```

### Output Example (System Deps Missing)
```
Error: browserType.launch:
Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers.
Missing libraries: libglib-2.0.so.0 ...
```

**This is expected on NixOS without additional setup.**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Port 3000 is in use"
**Solution:** Test runner will automatically use port 3001
```
⚠ Port 3000 is in use, using port 3001 instead.
```

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@playwright/test'"
**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies
```bash
nix develop --command bun install
```

### Issue: "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe()"
**Solution:** Don't use `bun test`, use `bun run test`
```bash
# Wrong
bun test

# Correct
bun run test
```

### Issue: Tests timeout
**Solution:** Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
```typescript
timeout: 60000,  // 60 seconds instead of 30
```
