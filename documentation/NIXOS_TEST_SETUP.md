# ‚úÖ NixOS Test Setup Complete

## üéâ What Was Accomplished

All Playwright tests now run successfully on NixOS! Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **NixOS Playwright Integration** ‚úÖ

Updated `flake.nix` to include:
- System Chromium (`pkgs.chromium`)
- Environment variables for Playwright
- Convenience `nix run .#test` command

### 2. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** ‚úÖ

Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` that:
- Runs on push to main and pull requests
- Installs dependencies with Bun
- Installs Playwright browsers
- Runs linter, build, and all tests
- Uploads test reports on failure

### 3. **Precommit Hooks** ‚úÖ

Created `.husky/pre-commit` that:
- Runs `bun run lint` before commit
- Runs `bun run test` before commit
- Blocks commit if either fails

### 4. **Test Fixes** ‚úÖ

Fixed all 12 Playwright tests to work with:
- Next.js loading states
- Static site generation
- System Chromium browser
- NixOS environment

## üöÄ Usage

### Running Tests Locally (NixOS)

```bash
# Enter nix shell and run tests
nix develop --command bun run test

# Using convenience command
nix run .#test

# Interactive UI mode
nix develop --command bun run test:ui

# With visible browser
nix develop --command bun run test:headed
```

### Running Tests in CI

Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request to `main` branch

Workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

### Precommit Hooks

Hooks run automatically on `git commit`:
1. Lints code with ESLint
2. Runs all Playwright tests
3. Only allows commit if both pass

To skip (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## üìã Test Results

All 12 tests passing! üéâ

```
‚úÖ homepage should render the landing note
‚úÖ note page should render correctly
‚úÖ note content should be rendered
‚úÖ navigation between notes should work
‚úÖ wiki links should be rendered as clickable links
‚úÖ metadata should be displayed correctly
‚úÖ vertical scroll indicator should be present on card
‚úÖ horizontal scroll progress should be present in header
‚úÖ scroll indicators should sync when scrolling
‚úÖ markdown content should have proper paragraph spacing
‚úÖ 404 page should work for non-existent notes
‚úÖ all content files should be accessible

12 passed (11.9s)
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### flake.nix Changes

```nix
devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  packages = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
    pkgs.bun
    pkgs.chromium  # System browser for Playwright
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=${pkgs.chromium}/bin/chromium
    export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
  '';
};

# Convenience test command
apps.test = {
  type = "app";
  program = toString (pkgs.writeShellScript "test" ''
    export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=${pkgs.chromium}/bin/chromium
    export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
    ${pkgs.bun}/bin/bunx playwright test "$@"
  '');
};
```

### playwright.config.ts Changes

```typescript
projects: [
  {
    name: 'chromium',
    use: {
      ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
      // Use system chromium on NixOS
      launchOptions: {
        executablePath: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH,
      },
    },
  },
],
```

### package.json Changes

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "1.54.1",  // Matches nixpkgs version
    "playwright": "1.54.1"
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Version Compatibility

Playwright npm package version **must match** nixpkgs playwright-driver version:
- nixpkgs: **1.54.1**
- npm: **1.54.1** ‚úÖ

If versions mismatch, you'll see "Executable doesn't exist" errors.

### Test Command

‚ùå **Don't use:** `bun test` (runs Bun's test runner)
‚úÖ **Use:** `bun run test` (runs Playwright via bunx)

### CI vs Local

- **CI (GitHub Actions)**: Downloads browsers with `playwright install --with-deps`
- **Local (NixOS)**: Uses system Chromium via `pkgs.chromium`

Both approaches work correctly!

## üéØ Benefits

### Before
- ‚ùå Tests failed on NixOS with "missing dependencies" errors
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline
- ‚ùå No precommit hooks
- ‚ùå Manual testing only

### After
- ‚úÖ All 12 tests pass on NixOS
- ‚úÖ Automated CI/CD on GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Precommit hooks prevent broken commits
- ‚úÖ `nix run .#test` convenience command
- ‚úÖ Tests run in 11.9 seconds
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Updating Playwright

When nixpkgs updates playwright-driver:

1. Check nixpkgs version:
   ```bash
   nix eval nixpkgs#playwright-driver.version --raw
   ```

2. Update package.json to match:
   ```json
   {
     "devDependencies": {
       "@playwright/test": "X.Y.Z",
       "playwright": "X.Y.Z"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   nix develop --command bun install
   ```

4. Test:
   ```bash
   nix run .#test
   ```

### Adding New Tests

1. Add test to `tests/notes.spec.ts`
2. Use `.last()` for futuristic-card selectors (skips loading state)
3. Use `.markdown` class for content selectors (not `.typography-content`)
4. Wait for `networkidle` before assertions
5. Run locally: `nix run .#test`
6. Commit will auto-run tests via precommit hook
