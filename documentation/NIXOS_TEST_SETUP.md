# NixOS Playwright Test Setup

This document explains how Playwright tests are configured to work identically on NixOS (local) and GitHub Actions (CI).

## Overview

The project uses **Determinate Systems Nix** in both environments:
- **Local**: NixOS with flake.nix
- **CI**: Ubuntu with Determinate Nix Installer

This ensures:
- âœ… Identical test environments locally and in CI
- âœ… Same system chromium from nixpkgs
- âœ… No FHS compatibility issues
- âœ… Consistent browser versions
- âœ… Same commands work everywhere

## Configuration

### 1. Nix Flake (`flake.nix`)

The development shell includes:
- `pkgs.chromium` - System browser for Playwright
- Environment variables set in `shellHook`:
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` - Points to system chromium
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` - Prevents downloading browsers

Test command via flake apps:
```nix
apps.test = {
  type = "app";
  program = toString (pkgs.writeShellScript "test" ''
    export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=${pkgs.chromium}/bin/chromium
    export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
    ${pkgs.bun}/bin/bunx playwright test "$@"
  '');
};
```

### 2. Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`)

Simple configuration - same for both environments:
```typescript
launchOptions: {
  executablePath: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH,
}

webServer: {
  command: 'nix develop --command bun run dev',
  url: 'http://localhost:3000',
  reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
}
```

### 3. Version Compatibility

**IMPORTANT**: The Playwright npm package version must match the version in nixpkgs.

Current setup:
- nixpkgs (24.11): Playwright 1.54.1
- package.json: `"@playwright/test": "1.54.1"`

If you see browser version errors, check:
```bash
nix-env -qaP chromium --json | jq '.[].meta.version'
```

## Running Tests

### Local Development (NixOS)

```bash
# Run tests via flake app (recommended)
nix run .#test

# Run with UI mode
nix run .#test -- --ui

# Run with visible browser
nix run .#test -- --headed

# Or enter dev shell first
nix develop
bun run test
bun run test:ui
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The GitHub Actions workflow uses Determinate Nix:
```yaml
- name: Install Nix
  uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main

- name: Install dependencies
  run: nix develop --command bun install

- name: Run linter
  run: nix develop --command bun run lint

- name: Run build
  run: nix develop --command bun run build

- name: Run tests
  run: nix run .#test
```

**Identical commands locally and in CI!**

Both local and CI use:
- Same Nix flake environment
- Same system chromium from nixpkgs
- Same `nix run .#test` command

## Precommit Hook

The `.husky/pre-commit` hook runs:
1. Linter: `nix develop --command bun run lint`

Tests run in CI/CD to keep commits fast (~12s test suite).

## Troubleshooting

### "Executable doesn't exist" error

This means Playwright version mismatch. Fix:
1. Check nixpkgs version
2. Update `package.json` to match
3. Run `bun install`

### "Browser not found" in dev shell

Make sure you're in the nix development shell:
```bash
nix develop
echo $PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH
# Should show: /nix/store/.../bin/chromium
```

### Tests fail in CI but pass locally

Since both use the same Nix environment, this should be rare. Check:
- Timing issues (CI might be slower)
- Network issues in CI
- Environment-specific settings

## Benefits of Determinate Nix in CI

- ðŸš€ Fast installation (under 1 second)
- ðŸ“¦ Built-in binary cache (FlakeHub Cache)
- ðŸ”’ Reproducible environments
- âœ… Same setup locally and in CI
- ðŸŽ¯ No environment drift

## Test Results

All 12 tests passing! ðŸŽ‰

```
âœ… homepage should render the landing note
âœ… note page should render correctly
âœ… note content should be rendered
âœ… navigation between notes should work
âœ… wiki links should be rendered as clickable links
âœ… metadata should be displayed correctly
âœ… vertical scroll indicator should be present on card
âœ… horizontal scroll progress should be present in header
âœ… scroll indicators should sync when scrolling
âœ… markdown content should have proper paragraph spacing
âœ… 404 page should work for non-existent notes
