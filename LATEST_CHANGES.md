## Technical Details

### View Transitions Implementation
- Uses React's `unstable_ViewTransition` for page-level transitions
- Applies browser View Transitions API via CSS classes for card elements
- 0.3s fade-out followed by 0.3s fade-in with delay for smooth effect

### Selection Highlight Design
- Animated underline: 1px gradient line that shifts over 6 seconds
- Ambient glow: Soft radial gradient behind text pulsing over 4 seconds
- No padding changes - maintains original layout
- Uses cyan/teal theme colors for consistency

### Spacing Reductions
- `.header-top`: 50% less padding on mobile (1rem → 0.5rem)
- `.header-bottom`: min-height reduced from 2rem → 1rem
- `.header-progress`: min-height reduced from 1.5rem → 0.75rem
- `.footer-container`: vertical padding reduced by ~33%
